Getting Started with Statistics


Statistics 

It is the science of collecting , organizing and analyzing data.


Data

Facts or pieces of information, measured , collected and analyzed.


Applications
Data exploration
Model building and validation
Statical analysis
optimization and efficiency



Types of statistics

Descriptive statistics
It involves  methods for summarizing and organizing the data to make it understandable , this helps to describe the basic features of the data in a study 

measure of central tendency mean , median and mode

means of dispersion variance , standard deviation

data distribution, histogram , box plot , pie chart, pdf, pmf

summary statistics  five no summary q1,q2,q3,q4



Inferential statistics
Involves methods for making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data .It allows a hypothesis testing, estimation, and drawing conclusions.

hypothesis testing
p value 
confidence interval 
statistics analysis test imp


eg there are 20 statistics in your college and you have collected the height of students in the class
heights are recorded 
desip, what is the avg height of the class room measure of central tendency 
infre, are the height of the sample students in the classroom similar to what you expect in the entire college

Population and sample data

Population 
A population is the entire set of the objects or individuals of interest in a particular study , it includes all the members of a defined group that we are studying or collecting information

characteristics
complete set: contains all the observation of interest 
parameter: a numerical value summarizing all the data 

population mean()
population variance 

eg 1 population of student heights determine
market research 
medical study 


Sample data
It is the subset of the population that is used to represent the entire group, sampling involves selecting a group of individuals or observations from the population to draw conclusion about the whole world.

Characteristics
subset: it represents a portion of a population
statistics: a numerical value summarizing the data
sample  mean and variance
Random sampling

eg estimating
behavior
effectives  of a drug

SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
eg exit poll after elections


Probability sampling
every member of population has an equal chance of getting selected

Systematic sampling 
every n th person 
eg credit cards in airport, feedback survey and selected 11 member 

Stratified sampling
we divide the population in a strata in groups,  and segrate the groups by specifics characteristics 
eg age, division in a dep in office

Clustered sampling
divide the population in cluster, randomly selecting cluster then sampling all the members from the 

Multi stage sampling
Combining several cluster methods, usually involves selecting the clusters, then randomly sampling the clusters
eg , randomly selecting city



Non probability
individual ppl who are easy to reach

Convince Sampling
easy to reach

Judgmental Sampling
based on researchers judgment 
eg choose experts in the field

Snowball sampling
choosing people among them

Quota Sampling
eg caste, 



Types of Data

Quantitative data (numerical)

discrete 	and 	continuous 
whole no		any value
no on bank acc
children

Qualitative Data  (categorical)

Nominal	 and	 Ordinal 
gender	    ranks on the data, customer feedback, 
m, f



SCALES OF MEASURMENT OF DATA
It measures the nature of the information within the values assigned to the variables


4 primary scales of measurement

NOMINAL SCALES
It classifies data into distinct categories that do not have an intensive order.
eg qualitative data 

characteristics 
based on labels, ranks 
mutually exclusive 
no logical order among categories
eg gender , color red 5, blue 3 , pink -2

ORDINAL SCALES

Classifies the data into categorize that can be ranked or ordered

characteristics
data is categorized and ranked in a specific order
interval between the ranks are not necessary equal
eg: educational level, customer feedback 


INTERVAL SCALE
It categories the order and also specifies the exact difference between the intervals ,and also lack the true 0 point 

Characteristics
data is ordered and consistent intervals between the values
allows between the meaningful comparison between the difference
no true 0 point
ratio cannot be measured

eg temp 

RATIO SCALE

Order matters 
differences are measured 
contains 0 starting point
ratio can be measured 
eg student marks in a class
