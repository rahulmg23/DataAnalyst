Descriptive Statistics



**MEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDANCY** 

They are basically **statistical metrics** that describe the **center point or typical value of a dataset.**

They provide a single value that summarizes a set of data by **identifying** the central position within a dataset.



mean or average

median 

mode





**Mean** 

Is the sum of values divided by the  number of the values

eg population mean (nu)

&nbsp;  sample mean (x bar )



Population (N)  Sample (n)



**Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Total number of values) or, using mathematical notation, x̄ = Σx / N.** 



**Characteristics**  

Affected by extreme outliers 

Used for interval and ratio data







**Median**

It is the middle values in the dataset, when the values in the dataset are arranged in a ascending or descending order



eg = \[1,2,3,4,5] = 3     \[1,2,3,4,5,6] = 3+4/2 = 3.5

avg of even no's



**Characteristics**

Not affected by extreme outliers 

used for ordinal , interval and ratio data







**Mode** 

It is the value that appears the most frequently in the dataset

eg = 1,2,2,3,5,5,5 = mode = 5



bimodal = 2 different modes



**Characteristics**

**N**ot affected by extreme values 

used by all the 4 scales nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio







IMP

MEAN IS BEST USED WHEN THE DATA IS SYMETRICALLY DISTRIBUTED, PROVIDES A MATHEMATICAL AVERAGE



MEDAIN IS BEST USED WHEN SKEWED OR CONTAINS OUTLIERS 



MODE IS BEST USED FOR CATEGORICAL DATA
